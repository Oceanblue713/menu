      "You picked the best dress, you picked the most delicious food, you even picked the best color napkins for the wedding party, but did you pick the best honeymoon? Honeymoons are important milestones in the life of every couple. It is important to pick a trip that you and your partner will never forget. That’s why we at cruise newbie recommend a Honeymoon Cruise as the best way to have fun on your honeymoon and make memories that will last a lifetime. Below are 4 reasons why you should consider a cruise for your honeymoon. Romance When you are in a cruise you can watch the sun set from the balcony in your room together. You can have a private dinner for two, go dancing all night, or just relax under the sun together while drinking champagne. You can spend the night  looking at the stars together from the privacy of your own balcony. Cruises have an incredible number of options to spend time together and enjoy being with your new partner. While some people believe cruises are crowded, the ships are very big and every cruise line works very hard to create special places where you and your partner can spend time together. Luxury and Service Honeymoons are very special occasions, and you should receive the best service in a luxurious environment.  Cruises have some of the best service in the travel industry. When you are on a cruise you will be assigned a team of wait staff in the main dining room for your entire trip. This team will do their best to learn what you like and don’t like, and work very hard to make sure that every meal is memorable. You will also be assigned a cabin attendant whose job is to make sure your room is always to the highest standard. They clean your room twice a day, and are readily available just in case you need something like extra towels, or more shampoo. Are you relaxing in the jacuzzi? Waiters are available to bring you whatever drink you like from the bar. Would you like to eat something special? Room service in most cruise lines is included free of charge. If you want to be pampered, cruises are some of the best places for that in the world. Adventure It is also important to make fun and exciting memories with your new partner when you are on a honeymoon, and cruise ships are perfect for that. On many cruise ships you can learn how to surf together, learn how to rock climb, or even how to skydive! When your ship reaches a port you can explore coral reefs, ride jet skis, or even fly on some the longest zip lines in the world. If you enjoy history, you can explore historic cities fille with amazing cultures and even ancient Mayan Ruins! The possibilities to make unforgettable memories are endless! Value The best part is that all this is available for a fraction of the cost of regular vacations. While prices for cruises do change depending on the season, ship, and itinerary, you will find that cruises offer incredible value compared to other honeymoons. For the cost of a hotel in other types of vacations, you can get a balcony room, breakfast, lunch and dinner, and many exciting activities. Even the more luxurious and romantic specialty restaurants are a fraction of the price of similar restaurants on land.  If you are lucky and can afford to spend more money, you will find that the suites on cruises are some of the most amazing hotel accommodations in the world.
